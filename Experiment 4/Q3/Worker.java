/*Write a class Worker and derive classes DailyWorker and SalariedWorker from it.
Every worker has a name and a salary rate. Write method ComPay (int hours) to compute the week pay of every worker.
A Daily Worker is paid on the basis of the number of days he/she works. 
The Salaried Worker gets paid the wage for 40 hours a week no matter what the actual hours are.
Test this program to calculate the pay of workers.
You are expected to use the concept of polymorphism to write this program. */
